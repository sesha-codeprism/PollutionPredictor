<h2>Overview</h2>
<p> Using supervised machine learning to train a model with credit default data to determine the probability and/or classification (“default” vs “non-default”) of the user’s liability. The UI will take user input such as, such as education level, sex, marital status, payment history and income, and will return a classification. 

An app like this would be useful for financial and lending institutions to understand and manage the risk of their loans and lending portfolios. </p>

<h2>Goals/Outcome</h2>
<ul> 
  <li> Determining probability of user liability </li>
  <li> Creating an interactive UI that will take users input and return an output </li>
  <li> To determine if a neural network vs logistic regression is the better model for classification </li>
</ul>
